# 🧠 Mental Health and Productivity in Tech

This project analyzes how work conditions, gender, and company support impact mental health and productivity among tech employees. Inspired by the OSMI Mental Health in Tech Survey dataset (2022), we explore correlations and insights using Python, Pandas, and Seaborn.

## 🔍 Objective

To identify patterns between company culture, mental health support, and self-reported productivity.

## 📊 Dataset

- Simulated sample based on the [Kaggle Mental Health in Tech Survey](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/osmi/mental-health-in-tech-survey)
- Fields include: Age, Gender, Remote Work, Company Support, Mental Health Issue, Productivity Level

## 📈 Techniques

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualization (bar plots, heatmaps, group comparisons)
- Interpretation and communication of results

## 📌 Key Questions

- Are employees with company mental health support more productive?
- Does working remotely affect mental health positively or negatively?
- Are there gender-related differences in reporting or support?
